##Favorite Release from 2018
[Last year](https://twitter.com/irobarte/status/948999328596746241 “Favorite Releases from 2017”), my favorite releases included a broader range of genres, but this year, [tech death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_death_metal “Tech death Wiki page”) has overtaken the rest. Due in part to moving and in part to a busier schedule, I had less time to explore sites like [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/ “Bandcamp homepage”) and [Heavy Blog](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/ “Heavy Blog homepage”) for more releases of interest. This resulted in less variety and thus less exposure to albums outside the metal genre. That being said, this year was a big k-pop year for me, and I’ll putting together a list of my [favorite k-pop songs of the year](link to come “Favorite k-pop songs from 2018”).

This was also the first year in which I purchased more digital albums than physical ones. After almost two years of using Bandcamp, I’m am beginning to see its benefits and feel comfortable making the switch to digital. The only exception would be if I encounter releases like 2017’s [Triangle](https://schammasch.bandcamp.com/album/triangle “Triangle in Bandcamp”).

So, without further ado, I present to you my favorite release from 2018 in ascending order. Happy listening!!!
