Over the past couple years, k-pop has been slowly creeping into my everyday listening routine. Before then, it was mostly j-pop and j-rock that had captured my attention, and most due to the anime shows that I had been following. Like many that were around in the 90s, boy bands were a big thing for me. In fact, Backstreet Boys’ Millenium was the first album I ever bought, and to this date, few things lighten up my day more than a BSB or NSYNC song.

I really do not recall what were some of the songs that I began to listen to back then, but groups like Super Junior and SHINee were among the first to have made an impact. Since then, my journey into k-pop has expanded greatly. Likely due to my deep appreciation for 90s boy bands, the groups that I gravitate toward are those that to some extent stick to that sound. While I’m still able to appreciate other groups, it may take a while for me to warm up to them.

Below, you will find a list of my favorite songs from this year in ascending order. Happy listening!!!
